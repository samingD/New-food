            We ensure that our products meet export quality standards before
            dispatch. Our return policy assumes the following guidelines.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-black font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of hardwood charcoal products, returns are only
            accepted if the product does not materially match the specifications
            outlined in the final sales agreement. You must notify us within 3
            days of receiving the cargo if there is an issue.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-black font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Process</h2>
          <p>
            To initiate a review, please contact us immediately with clear
            photographic evidence of any issues. Our quality assurance team will
            evaluate the claim.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-black font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            If a return/refund is approved, refunds will optionally be credited
            securely via the original method of payment or compensated through
            replacement in future shipments, depending on our agreement.
